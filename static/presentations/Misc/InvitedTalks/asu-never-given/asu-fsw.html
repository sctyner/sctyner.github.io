# "Statistics" 

--

.pull-left[

No formal experience: 

- math
- data
- numbers
- sports

]

--

.pull-right[

Took one or two stats classes:

- model 
- hypothesis test
- `\(p\)`-value
- confusing

# Does this look familiar?

--

"bell curve" aka the **normal distribution** 

---
# The Normal Distribution

- Used to describe variability in a population

--

- Characterized by 2 parameters: 

--

- First, the *mean* value ( `\(\mu\)` ) (aka *average* aka *expected value*): the "best guess" for the population

--

- Second, the *standard deviation* ( `\(\sigma\)` ) (or *variance* which is equal to `\(\sigma^2\)`): the average distance an observation is from the average

--


For example: 

In the US, women's heights follow a normal distribution with mean 64in (5'4") and standard deviation 3in. (For women aged 20+. [Source.](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/series/sr_03/sr03_039.pdf))

- Pick a woman at random: best guess, she's 5'4", but wouldn't be surprised if she was as short as 5'1" or as tall as 5'7"

# What is statistics?

--

- **Statistics**: "the study of how best to collect, analyze, and draw conclusions from data" (from a textbook)

--

- **Statistics**: "a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, classification, analysis, interpretation of numerical facts, for drawing inferences on the basis of their quantifiable likelihood (probability) of data." (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics))

--

- **Statistics**: "the study of uncertainty" (my definition)

---
# Uncertainty

What is the average height of women in the US aged 20 years &amp; over? 

--

- Trick question (Sorry!)

--

There is NO WAY to know the true answer to this question 

--

**Ground truth**: the (usually un-knowable) facts of a population, case, etc. 

--

Unless we construct it, we can never be 100% certain about ground truth
