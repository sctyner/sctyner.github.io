I have started a [CRAN task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/) for Forensic Science. The CTV is available on my [Github page](https://github.com/sctyner/ctv-forsci). I welcome any feedback, additions, and pull requests.

This CRAN task view contains a list of packages, grouped by discipline, that can be used to perform forensci science tasks in R.

Unless otherwise mentioned, all packages presented with hyperlinks are available from CRAN, the Comprehensive R Archive Network.

Several of the areas discussed in this Task View are undergoing rapid change. Please send suggestions for additions and extensions for this task view to the [task view maintainer](mailto:sctyner90@gmail.com).

Contributions are always welcome, and encouraged. The source file for this particular task view file are also in a GitHub repository (see below) so that pull requests are also possible.

Provides several GUIs for the interpretation, simulation, and visualization of DNA mixture data. Depends on the [methods](../packages/methods/index.html), [tcltk](../packages/tcltk/index.html), [tcltk2](../packages/tcltk2/index.html), and [tkrplot](../packages/tkrplot) packages.
-   [mixsep](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mixsep/index.html): Authored by Date Torben Tvedebrink. Date last modified on CRAN: 2013-04-23. Implements analyses of 2- and 3-person DNA mixture separation in a GUI. Depends on the [MASS](../packages/MASS/index.html), [tcltk](../packages/tcltk/index.html), [tcltk2](../packages/tcltk2/index.html), and [RODBC](../packages/RODBC) packages.
-   [rforensicbatwing](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rforensicbatwing): Authored by Mikkel Meyer Andersen and Ian J. Wilson. Date last modified on CRAN: 2014-06-27. An R implementation of the C program BATWING for calculating forensic trace-suspect match probabilities. The primary functions `batwing` and `coalmatchprob` estimate the trace-suspect match probability for a lineage haplotype of STR markers using [coalescent theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coalescent_theory).
-   [strvalidator](https://cran.r-project.org/package=strvalidator/index.html): Authored by Oskar Hansson. Date last modified on CRAN: 2017-08-11. From the author, "An open source platform for validation and process control. Tools to analyze data from internal validation of forensic short tandem repeat (STR) kits are provided." Requires installation of [RGtk2](../packages/RGtk2) among other packages, and this [can be difficult](https://gist.github.com/sebkopf/9405675#troubleshooting-for-gtk-224-issues).
-   [pcrsim](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pcrsim/index.html): Authored by Oskar Hansson. Date last modified on CRAN: 2017-03-17. Provides GUI for simulating the forensic DNA process: generate random or fixed DNA profiles, create forensic samples including mixtures of diploid and haploid cells, simulate DNA extraction, normalization, degradation, amplification including stutters and inter-locus balance, and capillary electrophoresis. Depends on [strvalidator](../packages/strvalidator).

**Glass Evidence**

From the authors, "functions for simulating the number of recovered glass fragments given the conditions set by the user on factors affecting the transfer, persistence and recovery of glass fragments. A large simulation size will provide precise estimates of transfer probabilities to be used in the Bayesian interpretation of forensic glass evidence." Depends on [methods](../packages/methods) package.
